# Gapless React-Native Coding Challenge

Hello and thanks for taking the time to try this out.

The goal of this test is to assert (to some degree) your coding and architectural skills. You're given a simple problem so you can focus on showcasing your development techniques.

As this is a code review process, please avoid adding generated code to the project. This makes our jobs as reviewers more difficult, as we can't review code you didn't write.

_Note: While we love open source here at Gapless, please do not create a public repo with your test in! This challenge is only shared with people we're interviewing and for obvious reasons we'd like it to remain this way._

## The task üèÅ
![Challenge](/challenge.png)

1. Create a mini garage with react-native filled with cars from `https://static.gapless.app/app/challenge/data.json`. The app should indicate when vehicles are being loaded with a loader/spinner
2. The user should be able to star cars, starred cars should show up first.
3. Your task is to create a mini Garage with React-Native, consisting of a garage filled with cars. The user should be able to star cars, starred cars should show up first and should remain starred even if the app restarts.

## What will we be looking at
- Component composition: where and how you define the boundaries of your components and how they are assembled
- Attention to detail and UI Performance: How faithfully designs and animations are implemented to provide the best possible user experience (please feel free to use any font you want)
- Code reusability, readability and maintainability
- Finding the right point of abstraction in your UI components, helpers functions and APIs

## Evaluation Criterias
- You're free to use as many third party JS libraries that you see fit
- You know Redux? then use it (evaluation criteria point)
- Tests, type checking, linting... are nice to have (evaluation criteria point for each)

##### Happy hacking!
